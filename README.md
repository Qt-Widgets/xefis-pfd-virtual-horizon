XEFIS
=====

Xefis is a framework that helps writing software for remote controlled vehicles
and their ground stations.

It focuses on flying vehicles.

It has:
    * display modules (EFIS) for ADI, HSI, various gauges
    * communication modules with encryption and authentication support (eg. to connect GCS and the aircraft)
    * a couple of hardware communication modules (BMP085 pressure sensor, EagleTree Airspeed sensor, XBee modem,
      NMEA GPS modules, CHR UM6 IMU)
    * computation modules to obtain performance and navigation data from sensor data
      (airspeed, altitude, bearing, track, various other speeds, etc),
    * automation modules that can automatically control a model
    * rigid-body simulation framework to help testing of models
    * basic system that allows data exchange between the modules

Notes:
No-one uses this besides the author. Don't expect any support.
